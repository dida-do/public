# Collaborative filtering

The notebook `collaborative_filtering.ipynb` accompanies the blogpost about collaborative filtering: https://dida.do/blog/collaborative_filtering

You can open it directly in colab:

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/k-mundinger/public/blob/master/collaborative_filtering/collaborative_filtering.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

or run it locally by cloning this repository.

I would recommend to create a virtual environment:

`python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate`

and then, with the environment activated

`(venv) pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you are using vanilla jupyter, you may want to make the environment available in jupyter by running

`(venv) ipython kernel install --user --name=some-name`

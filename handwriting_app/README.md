# Handwriting web app

This is a Tensorflow.js app which predicts handwritten characters. The tutorial is found on dida's blog [How to distribute a Tensorflow model as a JavaScript web app](https://dida.do/blog/how-to-distribute-a-tensorflow-model-as-a-javascript-web-app).

Try out the [live demo](https://raw.githack.com/dida-do/public/master/handwriting_app/web/index.html) in your mobile phone or on your desktop computer.

The model training is found in [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/dida-do/public/blob/master/handwriting_app/EMNISTKeras.ipynb).
